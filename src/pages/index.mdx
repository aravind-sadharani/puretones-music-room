## What is PureTones?

PureTones is an [App](/app/) for learning, understanding and making musical works in Indian Classical music.

We have built PureTones based on an in-depth study and exploration of Indian Classical music to understand the role of harmonics, microtones and consonance in Indian Ragas and musical scales. It consists of a family of tools:

-   **PureTones Drone** is a digital Tanpura (or Tambura) with controls for fine tuning the strings and adjusting their harmonic envelope. This enables skilled Indian Classical musicians to fine tune the harmonic envelope to suit whichever Raga they wish to perform or practice.
-   **PureTones Musical Scale** is a digital 12 note keyboard with controls for fine tuning each key to be consonant with an accompanying drone track. This enables skilled Indian Classical musicians to fine tune the musical scale to go with the PureTones Drone which they have finely tuned.
-   **PureTones Sequencer** is a sequencer which enables composition of melodies and musical works in Indian Classical music using notes from a fine tuned musical scale. It uses a simple but powerful grammar to accurately describe an Indian Classical music composition including support for microtones and note modulations. It synthesizes the audio from the description and plays it back.

Contrary to widely held perceptions, a Tanpura in Indian Classical music is not only responsible for providing a reference of the fundamental note **Sa**. It actually provides a tuning system resulting from string overtones which supports the entire Raga being performed. Skilled artists then employ appropriate shades of each note in the Raga they perform to render each note with utmost accuracy and clarity, in tune with the Tanpura. To understand this better, read [this article](/learn/tanpuraworking/) which illustrates the role of the Tanpura in Indian Classical music.

## Who are we?

The PureTones team consists of:

-   **S Balachander**, an Indian Classical musician, multi-instrumentalist, and inventor and performing artist of [Chandraveena](https://www.chandraveena.com/), and
-   **Aravind Iyer**, a scientist and computer engineer, music technologist and a general music enthusiast.

## Background of PureTones

PureTones tools are built based on an understanding of the history and evolution of Indian Classical music. The history of Indian Classical music can be said to start from around 1200 BCE with the singing of passages from Sama Veda. Since then Indian Classical music has evolved and gone through significant developments on its way to its present day form. Through in-depth articles with a variety of samples and musical demonstrations, we have attempted to shed some light on the following important aspects of Indian Classical music:

-   [Indian Tuning Systems](/learn/tuningsystems/) - which reconstructs two historically significant tuning systems.
-   [Indian Musical Scales](/learn/musicalscales/) - which traces the lineage of the concept of Raga.
-   [Tanpura - a cornerstone of Indian Classical music](/learn/tanpuraworking/) - which illustrates the significant musical impact of the Tanpura.

All these articles feature samples and demonstrations which have been created using PureTones tools.

## PureTones Showcase

PureTones is used by the following artists to create their musical works.

- [Chandraveena](https://www.chandraveena.com) - S Balachander on Chandraveena. Balachander makes extensive use of PureTones for his background drone tracks and also for exploring microtones and consonances in Indian Ragas and musical scales.
- [Ragatronics](https://ragatronics.sadharani.com) - A fusion of Indian Classical music with elements of rock, jazz and electronic music. Ragatronics features musical works composed by S Balachander and Aravind Iyer, but sequenced and recorded using PureTones.

## Technology behind PureTones

PureTones has been developed using [Faust](https://faust.grame.fr/), a functional programming language for sound synthesis and audio processing.

The Drone and Scale apps are built using the command line tool `faust2webaudio` (see [Faust Tools](https://faustdoc.grame.fr/manual/tools/) for details), while the Sequencer app has been built using [faust2webaudio](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust2webaudio) which enables dynamic, in-browser compilation of Faust codes generated by the Sequencer app from the musical compositions. These tools use [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) for efficient real-time audio synthesis.

PureTones uses [React](https://reactjs.org), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) to deploy the PureTones tools, articles and audio demonstrations, in the form of a website and web application.
