## What is PureTones?

PureTones is a family of software tools for Indian Classical music. They are built based on an in-depth study and exploration of Indian Classical music to understand the role of harmonics, microtones and consonance in Indian Ragas and musical scales.

-   [PureTones Drone](/app/) is a digital Tanpura with controls for fine tuning the strings and adjusting their harmonic envelope.
-   [PureTones Musical Scale](/app/) is a digital 12 note keyboard with controls for fine tuning each key to be consonant with an accompanying drone track.
-   [PureTones Sequencer](/app/) is a sequencer which enables composition of melodies and musical works in Indian Classical music using notes from a fine tuned musical scale.

## Who are we?

The Ragatronics team consists of:

-   **S Balachander**, an Indian Classical musician, multi-instrumentalist, and inventor & performing artist of [Chandraveena](https://www.chandraveena.com/), and
-   **Aravind Iyer**, a scientist and computer engineer, music technologist, part-time drummer and general music enthusiast.

## Background of PureTones

PureTones tools are built based on an understanding of the history and evolution of Indian Classical music. The history of Indian Classical music can be said to start from around 1200 BCE with the singing of passages from Sama Veda. Since then Indian Classical music has evolved and gone through significant developments on its way to its present day form. Through in-depth articles with a variety of samples and musical demonstrations, we have attempted to shed some light on the following important aspects of Indian Classical music:

-   [Indian Tuning Systems](/tuningsystems/) - which reconstructs two historically significant tuning systems.
-   [Indian Musical Scales](/musicalscales/) - which traces the lineage of the concept of Raga.
-   [Tanpura - a cornerstone of Indian Classical music](/tanpuraworking/) - which illustrates the significant musical impact of the Tanpura.

All these articles feature samples and demonstrations which have been created using PureTones tools.

## PureTones Showcase
