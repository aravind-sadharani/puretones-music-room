## Scale Builder for Indian musical scales

Scale Builder is a tool to build microtonally accurate scales for Ragas in Indian Classical music. For an introduction to Scale Builder and a quick user guide, click `Show`. You can use the common parameters below to set the `Sa` to any pitch you prefer.

### Introduction

Indian Ragas and their underlying scales are based on the principles of consonance and symmetry. This means that the interval between any two notes in a Raga can be described:
* Using the common intervals of *Pancham* (fifth), *Madhyam* (fourth) and *Gandhar* (major third), or
* By means of symmetrical intervals in a different part of the octave in that Raga.

By specifying these musical intervals, you can use Scale Builder to build microtonally accurate scales for Indian Ragas. Scale Builder uses *Linear Algebra* to solve for a scale that meets all the *constraints* imposed by the musical intervals you specify.

### Syntax

The musical intervals in a scale are specified as constraints. Each constraint is specified in a separate line using intervals.

* Individual notes are denoted as `Sa re Re ga Ga ma Ma Pa dha Dha ni Ni` where notes beginning with a lower case letter are *komal* or flat notes, and notes beginning with an upper case letter are *tivra* or sharp notes.
* There are three *Saptaks* (octaves):  *Mandra* (low), *Madhya* (middle) and *Tara* (high). A `"` symbol denotes *Tara Saptak*, a `'` symbol denotes *Mandra Saptak* and no octave specification means *Madhya Saptak*.
* `(Sa,Pa)` stands for the interval from Sa to Pa.
* `(Sa,Pa)` is the same as `(Pa,Sa)`, but different from `(Pa,Sa")`.
* `I(P)`, `I(m)` and `I(G)` are respectively the *Pancham*, *Madhyam* and *Gandhar* intervals.
* So `(Sa,Pa) = I(P)` means that `Sa` and `Pa` have a *Pancham* relationship (which need not always be the case).
* `(Pa,Dha) = (ma,Pa)` means that the `Pa-Dha` interval and `ma-Pa` interval are the same.
* `(Re)` is a shortcut for `(Sa,Re)`.
* `S(note)` means that the `note` should use the *standard* value from the Venkatamakhin-Ramamatya tuning system. For example, `(ga) = S(ga)` means that `ga` should use the standard value.
* `D(note)` means that the `note` should be deleted from the scale (although it may be used to derive another note in the scale). For example, `D(Pa)` means that `Pa` is not be used in the scale.
* `T(note)` means that the generated scale should be transposed with the `note` taken as the tonic note. For example, `T(ma)` means that the generated scale should be transposed to `ma`.

### Examples

#### Sama Gana Scale

```
(Sa,Pa) = I(P)
(Sa,ma) = I(m)
(Sa,Re) = (ma,Pa)
(ga,ma) = (ma,Pa)
(Pa,Dha) = (ma,Pa)
(ni,Sa") = (ma,Pa)
```

#### Shadaj Gram Scale

```
(Sa,Pa) = I(P)
(Sa,ma) = I(m)
(ga,ma) = (ma,Pa)
(ni,Sa") = (ma,Pa)
(ma,Dha) = I(G)
(Re,Dha) = I(P)
```
