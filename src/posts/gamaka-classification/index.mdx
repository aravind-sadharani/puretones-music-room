## Introduction

We have looked at the [historical evolution]((/learn/historical-milestones/)) of Indian Classical music, and seen how its [tuning systems](/learn/tuningsystems-1/) have developed based on the principles of consonance.

But beyond the tuning of musical intervals, the concept of *Gamaka* occupies a position of pre-eminence in Indian Classical music. A *Gamaka* is a musical ornamentation carried out by modulating the pitch of a note or by moving continuously from one note to another.

In this article, we interpret the different types of *Gamakas* described in *[Sangeet Ratnakar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangita_Ratnakara)* by [Sarang Dev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C4%81r%E1%B9%85gadeva).

## Reference Pitch and Basic Intervals

Before we begin, let us start with the concept of the fundamental note **Sa**. In Indian Classical music, all musical notes are defined based on their relationship with **Sa**. You can use the settings below to set the **Sa** to any pitch you prefer. All the demos on this page would play according to this setting.

<CommonPitch />

## Standard Drone

For the purposes of this article, we will use the *Standard* drone tuning. Click `Start` below and listen to the drone track for some time.

<DronePlayer title='Standard Drone' settings={standardDrone} />

After you have spent some time and feel comfortable with the drone track, you can move to the subsequent sections. Let the drone track continue to play while you read and listen to the remainder of this article.

## Panchadasa Gamakas in Sangeet Ratnakar

### Tiripa

export const tiripaGamaka = `Sa re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ,
ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ,
re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ,`

<MotifPlayer title='Tiripa Gamaka' motif={tiripaGamaka} scale={standardScale} />

Shake sounding like damaru speeding in quarter druta.

### Sphurita

$1 \over 3$ rd of druta - I couldn't synthesise this.

### Kampita

Half a druta without any shade of the next swara.

export const kampitaGamaka = `Sa re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ; re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ;
ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ; ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ;
re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ; re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ;`

<MotifPlayer title='Kampita Gamaka' motif={kampitaGamaka} scale={standardScale} />

### Lina

Speed of druta

export const linaGamaka = `Sa re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) . re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) .
ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) . ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) .
re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) . re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) .`

<MotifPlayer title='Lina Gamaka' motif={linaGamaka} scale={standardScale} />

### Andolita

Speed of laghu - it is not clear if it's once or can be multiple times.

export const andolitaGamaka = `Sa re(G)(0,15,4,0.95) ga(G)(0,15,4,0.95)
re(G)(0,15,4,0.95) re(G)(0,15,4,0.95)`

<MotifPlayer title='Andolita Gamaka' motif={andolitaGamaka} scale={standardScale} />

### Vali

Vakra and different speeds

export const valiGamaka = `Sa re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ,
Ma(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ;  Ma(G)(0,15,4,0.95) .
re(G)(0,15,8,0.95)  , dha(G)(0,15,4,0.95)
dha(G)(0,15,4,0.95) ; ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ,
Ma(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , dha(G)(0,15,4,0.95) .
Ni(G)(0,15,4,0.95) . dha(G)(0,15,4,0.95) . SA`

<MotifPlayer title='Vali Gamaka' motif={valiGamaka} scale={standardScale} />

### Tribhinna

Cover three registers without pause with Ghana voice

### Kurula

Like Vali but with soft voice

### Ahata

Touch the succeeding note and return

export const ahataGamaka = `Sa re(G)(re,ga,4,0.95) ga(G)(ga,Ma,4,0.95)
Ma(G)(Ma,dha,4,0.95) dha(G)(dha,Ni,4,0.95)
Ma(G)(Ma,dha,4,0.95) ga(G)(ga,Ma,4,0.95)
re(G)(re,ga,4,0.95)`

<MotifPlayer title='Ahata Gamaka' motif={ahataGamaka} scale={standardScale} />

Pratyahata is not mentioned here, but I think thats the descending Ahata like `ga(G)(ga,re,4.0.95)` etc.

### Ullasita

Reach succeeding notes in order

export const ullasitaGamaka = `Sa re(G)(Sa,re,4,0.5) ga(G)(re,ga,4,0.5)
Ma(G)(ga,Ma,4,0.5) dha(G)(Ma,dha,4,0.5)
Ma(G)(dha,Ma,4,0.5) ga(G)(Ma,ga,4,0.5)
re(G)(ga,re,4,0.5)`

<MotifPlayer title='Ullasita Gamaka' motif={ullasitaGamaka} scale={standardScale} />

### Plavita

Shake in pluta 

### Humphita

Shake with sounding hum

### Mudrita

Shake with mouth closed

### Namita

Haven't been able to decode

### Misra

A combination of the above.

### All Gamakas in Succession

export const allGamakas = `Sa re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ,
Sa re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ; re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ; ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ; ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ; re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ; re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ;

## Dasavidha Gamakas

While Sangeet Ratnakar acts as a reference to many treatises written post Sarang Dev era across India, music of the North India and South India has gone through its own evolution independently. The music of the South, also known as Carnatic tradition recognises Dasavidha Gamakas - 10 Gamakas. This is a later conception. Though there are some variants, and differences in description among different scholars, here we present the most commonly understood - and using some of our own musical judgement - in presenting the Dasavidha Gamakas.

### Arohana

A graceful movement of notes in ascending order.

export const arohanaGamaka = `Sa re(G)(re,ga,4,0.95) ga
Ma(G)(Ma,dha,4,0.95) dha Ni SA`

<MotifPlayer title='Arohana Gamaka' motif={arohanaGamaka} scale={standardScale} />

### Avarohana

A graceful movement of notes in descending order.

export const avarohanaGamaka = `SA Ni(G)(Ni,SA,4,0.95) dha
Ma(G)(Ma,dha,4,0.95) ga re Sa`

<MotifPlayer title='Avarohana Gamaka' motif={avarohanaGamaka} scale={standardScale} />

### Dhalu

Starting on basic note Sa, and producing the higher notes keeping the raga bhava - and again in descending order to the same swara.

export const dhaluGamaka = `Sa dha Sa Ma Sa ga Sa re`

<MotifPlayer title='Dhalu Gamaka' motif={dhaluGamaka} scale={standardScale} />

### Sphuritam

Here there is a difference between Sangeet Ratnakar, and as commonly understood in Carnatic tradition. This Gamaka takes its inspiration from Veena technique. Here we use the concept of what is called Janta swarams, or notes in pairs. For eg, SaSa ReRe or SaRe ReGa etc. The technique involves playing the second note with a slight touch of the previous fret without sounding the note.

An example of SaSa rere gaga:

export const sphuritamGamaka1 = `Sa Sa(G)(Ni',Sa,20,0.5)^ , Sa
re re(G)(Sa,re,20,0.5)^ , re
ga ga(G)(Re,ga,20,0.5)^ , ga
Ma Ma(G)(ma,Ma,20,0.5)^ , Ma
dha dha(G)(Pa,dha,20,0.5)^ , dha`

<MotifPlayer title='Sphuritam Gamaka1' motif={sphuritamGamaka1} scale={standardScale} />

An example of Sare rega gaMa:

export const sphuritamGamaka2 = `Sa re re(G)(Sa,re,20,0.5)^ , ga ga(G)(Re,ga,20,0.5)^ , Ma
Ma(G)(ma,Ma,20,0.5)^ , dha`

<MotifPlayer title='Sphuritam Gamaka2' motif={sphuritamGamaka2} scale={standardScale} />

### Kampita

Same as in Sangeet Ratnakar. Half a druta without any shade of the next swara.

export const kampitaGamaka1 = `Sa re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ; re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ;
ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ; ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ;
re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ; re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ;`

<MotifPlayer title='Kampita Gamaka' motif={kampitaGamaka1} scale={standardScale} />

### Ahata

Same as in Sangeet Ratnakar but with a slight twist. This is played in pairs, so after touching the next and returning, you play the next note, for eg. SaReSa Ga.

export const ahataGamaka1 = `Sa re(G)(re,ga,4,0.95) ga ga(G)(ga,Ma,4,0.95) Ma
Ma(G)(Ma,dha,4,0.95) dha`

<MotifPlayer title='Ahata Gamaka' motif={ahataGamaka1} scale={standardScale} />

### Pratyahata

The reverse of Ahata - ie, SANiSA Ni etc..

export const pratyahataGamaka1 = `SA(G)(SA,Ni,4,0.95) Ni Ni(G)(Ni,dha,4,0.95) dha dha(G)(dha,Ma,4,0.95) Ma
Ma(G)(Ma,ga,4,0.95) ga ga(G)(ga,re,4,0.95) re re(G)(re,Sa,4,0.95) Sa`

<MotifPlayer title='Pratyahata Gamaka' motif={pratyahataGamaka1} scale={standardScale} />

### Tripuscha

Swaras rendered in triplets Eg, SaSaSa ReReRe etc. I would think this should be rendered with a slight shake.

export const tripuschaGamaka = `Sa re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ,
ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ,
re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , Sa`

<MotifPlayer title='Tripuscha Gamaka' motif={tripuschaGamaka} scale={standardScale} />

### Andola

Mixture of single and deergha swaras Eg: SaReSa Ga 2 Ga

export const andolaGamaka = `Sa re(G)(re,ga,4,0.95) ga 2 ga re(G)(re,ga,4,0.95) re 2 re Sa` 

<MotifPlayer title='Andola Gamaka' motif={andolaGamaka} scale={standardScale} />

### Murchhana

Linear sequence of swaras of the Raga commencing from a starting swara. Eg; Sa Re Ga ma Pa Dha Ni, Ni' Sa Re Ga ma Pa Dha etc.

export const murchhanaGamaka = `Sa . re . ga . Ma . dha . Ni Ni' . Sa . re . ga . Ma . dha dha' . Ni' . Sa . re . ga . Ma` 

<MotifPlayer title='Murchhana Gamaka' motif={murchhanaGamaka} scale={standardScale} />
