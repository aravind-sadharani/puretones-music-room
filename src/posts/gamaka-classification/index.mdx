## Introduction

We have looked at the [historical evolution]((/learn/historical-milestones/)) of Indian Classical music, and seen how its [tuning systems](/learn/tuningsystems-1/) have developed based on the principles of consonance.

But beyond the tuning of musical intervals, the concept of *Gamaka* occupies a position of pre-eminence in Indian Classical music. A *Gamaka* is a musical ornamentation carried out by modulating the pitch of a note or by moving continuously from one note to another.

In this article, we interpret the different types of *Gamakas* described in *[Sangeet Ratnakar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangita_Ratnakara)* by [Sarang Dev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C4%81r%E1%B9%85gadeva).

## Reference Pitch and Basic Intervals

Before we begin, let us start with the concept of the fundamental note **Sa**. In Indian Classical music, all musical notes are defined based on their relationship with **Sa**. You can use the settings below to set the **Sa** to any pitch you prefer. All the demos on this page would play according to this setting.

<CommonPitch />

## Standard Drone

For the purposes of this article, we will use the *Standard* drone tuning. Click `Start` below and listen to the drone track for some time.

<DronePlayer title='Standard Drone' settings={standardDrone} />

After you have spent some time and feel comfortable with the drone track, you can move to the subsequent sections. Let the drone track continue to play while you read and listen to the remainder of this article.

## Gamakas in Sangeet Ratnakar

### Tiripa

export const tiripaGamaka = `Sa re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ,
ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ,
re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ,`

<MotifPlayer title='Tiripa Gamaka' motif={tiripaGamaka} scale={standardScale} />

Shake sounding like damaru speeding in quarter druta.

### Sphurita

$1 \over 3$ rd of druta - I couldn't synthesise this.

### Kampita

Half a druta

export const kampitaGamaka = `Sa re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ; re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ;
ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ; ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ;
re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ; re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ;`

<MotifPlayer title='Kampita Gamaka' motif={kampitaGamaka} scale={standardScale} />

### Lina

Speed of druta

export const linaGamaka = `Sa re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) . re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) .
ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) . ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) .
re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) . re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) .`

<MotifPlayer title='Lina Gamaka' motif={linaGamaka} scale={standardScale} />

### Andolita

Speed of laghu - it is not clear if it's once or can be multiple times.

export const andolitaGamaka = `Sa re(G)(0,15,4,0.95) ga(G)(0,15,4,0.95)
re(G)(0,15,4,0.95) re(G)(0,15,4,0.95)`

<MotifPlayer title='Andolita Gamaka' motif={andolitaGamaka} scale={standardScale} />

### Vali

Vakra and different speeds

export const valiGamaka = `Sa re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ,
Ma(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ;  Ma(G)(0,15,4,0.95) .
re(G)(0,15,8,0.95)  , dha(G)(0,15,4,0.95)
dha(G)(0,15,4,0.95) ; ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ,
Ma(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , dha(G)(0,15,4,0.95) .
Ni(G)(0,15,4,0.95) . dha(G)(0,15,4,0.95) . SA`

<MotifPlayer title='Vali Gamaka' motif={valiGamaka} scale={standardScale} />

### Tribhinna

Cover three registers without pause with Ghana voice

### Kurula

Like Vali but with soft voice

### Ahata

Touch the succeeding note and return

export const ahataGamaka = `Sa re(G)(re,ga,4,0.95) ga(G)(ga,Ma,4,0.95)
Ma(G)(Ma,dha,4,0.95) dha(G)(dha,Ni,4,0.95)
Ma(G)(Ma,dha,4,0.95) ga(G)(ga,Ma,4,0.95)
re(G)(re,ga,4,0.95)`

<MotifPlayer title='Ahata Gamaka' motif={ahataGamaka} scale={standardScale} />

Pratyahata is not mentioned here, but I think thats the descending Ahata like `ga(G)(ga,re,4.0.95)` etc.

### Ullasita

Reach succeeding notes in order

export const ullasitaGamaka = `Sa re(G)(Sa,re,4,0.5) ga(G)(re,ga,4,0.5)
Ma(G)(ga,Ma,4,0.5) dha(G)(Ma,dha,4,0.5)
Ma(G)(dha,Ma,4,0.5) ga(G)(Ma,ga,4,0.5)
re(G)(ga,re,4,0.5)`

<MotifPlayer title='Ullasita Gamaka' motif={ullasitaGamaka} scale={standardScale} />

### Plavita

Shake in pluta 

### Humphita

Shake with sounding hum

### Mudrita

Shake with mouth closed

### Namita

Haven't been able to decode

### Misra

A combination of the above.

### All Gamakas in Succession

export const allGamakas = `Sa re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , ga(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) , re(G)(0,15,8,0.95) ,
