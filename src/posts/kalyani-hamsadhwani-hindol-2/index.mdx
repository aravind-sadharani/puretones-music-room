## Introduction

In an [earlier article](/learn/kalyani-hamsadhwani-hindol/), we analyzed three Ragas: *Kalyani*, *Hamsadhwani* and *Hindol* and saw how they were related to one another. During the analysis, we made a choice to maintain the intervals `(Re,Ma)` and `(Pa,Ni)` as symmetrical. As a keen reader or listener would have observed, this resulted in the note `Ga` not being Antara Gandhar but slightly sharper in pitch. If you have not read the article and listened to the analysis and audio demos, then you may want to do so.

In this article, we analyze the same three Ragas and construct a common scale for them, by treating the intervals `(Sa,Ga)` and `(Pa,Ni)` as symmetrical. Read on, if you are keen to find out how the scale changes subtly because of this choice.

## Reference Pitch and Basic Intervals

Before we begin, let us start with the concept of the fundamental note **Sa**. In Indian Classical music, all musical notes are defined based on their relationship with **Sa**. You can use the settings below to set the **Sa** to any pitch you prefer. All the demos on this page would play according to this setting.

<CommonPitch />

Next, it is useful to familiarize ourselves with the four basic intervals of *Dviguna*  (octave), *Pancham* (fifth), *Madhyam* (fourth) and *Gandhar* (major third). You can play and check these intervals using the keyboard below (just click `Start` to activate and tap a key to play). Here **Sa** denotes the fundamental and **Ga, ma, Pa** and **SA** denote the Gandhar, Madhyam, Pancham and Dviguna respectively. Note that the notes here do not match up with today's standard [12 tone equally tempered scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_equal_temperament).

    {white: "Sa", black: "fade"},

    {white: "ma", black: "fade"},
    {white: "Pa", black: "fade"},
    {white: "fade", black: "fade"},
    {white: "fade"},
    {white: "SA"}
]

As you can hear, Pancham, Madhyam and Gandhar are pleasant sounding intervals. For the musically inclined, they may be recognisable by ear. These are the most fundamental intervals in Indian Classical music which a trained musician is expected to recognize with a fine level of precision.

## Scale for Raga Kalyani

Let us start by examining some common phrases in Raga Kalyani. Here are a few fragments of phrases which are used to construct musical phrases in Raga Kalyani.

Based on these phrase fragments, we can deduce the note relationships required for the phrases to sound correct and aesthetically appealing. Using the basic intervals introduced above, we can see that:

* Updated points

* Updated points

* Updated points

Using the above analysis of the phrases, the scale for Raga Kalyani can be built using the [Scale Builder](/scalebuilder/) tool with the following inter-note relationships.

```
(Sa,Pa) = I(P)
(Re,Pa) = I(m)
(Sa,Ga) = I(G)
(Ga,Pa) = (Ma,Dha)
(Ga,Ni) = I(P)
(Ga,Dha) = I(m)
```

The above relationships result in the following scale. Click `Start` below to expand the scale controls. Then play each note one at a time. For each note, observe how it sounds in relation to other notes in the scale.

export const noteSpecKalyani = [
    {white: "Sa", black: "fade"},
    {white: "Re", black: "fade"},
    {white: "Ga"},
    {white: "fade", black: "Ma"},
    {white: "Pa", black: "fade"},
    {white: "Dha", black: "fade"},
    {white: "Ni"},
    {white: "SA"}

<Notice>

**Note :** Being an artistic tradition, Indian Classical music uses both objective and subjective criteria to characterize Ragas. Bearing that in mind, there is an element of subjectivity involved in the process of selecting signature phrases in a Raga and then applying the basic intervals to those phrases to make the aesthetically appealing. However, once the inter-note relationships are fixed, the scale can be objectively and mathematically derived with microtonally accurate tuning.

## Drone for Raga Kalyani

Before we compare Raga Kalyani with Raga Hamsadhwani and Raga Hindol, let us start with the drone track for Raga Kalyani. Click `Start` below and listen to the drone track for some time.

<DronePlayer title='Drone for Raga Kalyani' settings={kalyaniDrone2} />

After you have spent some time and feel comfortable with the drone track, you can move to the subsequent sections. Let the drone track continue to play while you read and listen to the remainder of this article.

Note that the drone has been tuned to support the Kalyani scale derived above and to emphasize the associated note relationships.

## Simple Phrases in Raga Kalyani

Here are some simple phrases to understand the scale and structure of Raga Kalyani.

SA Ni Dha Pa Ma Re Ga Pa Re Sa 2`

<MotifPlayer title='Aarohi and Avarohi phrases for Raga Kalyani' motif={kalyaniMotif} scale={kalyaniScale2} />

## Raga Hamsadhwani

Raga Hamsadhwani is a pentatonic Raga with the scale `Sa Re Ga Pa Ni`. Consequently, some experts believe it is a derivative of *Raga Shankarabharanam*, while others believe it is a derivative of *Raga Kalyani*. Here we present it as a derivative of *Raga Kalyani*.

The important inter-note relationships in Raga Hamsadhwani are as follows:

```
(Sa,Pa) = I(P)
(Pa',Re) = I(P)
(Pa,Ni) = I(G)
```

If you observe closely, you can see that these relationships are already present among those listed for Raga Kalyani. So, by dropping Ma and Dha (Ma, Dha are *Varjit* or prohibited), we can arrive at the required scale with the required symmetry for Raga Hamsadhwani.

Many of the Kalyani phrases can directly be rendered in Raga Hamsadhwani just by dropping the *Varjit* notes. For example, the Kalyani phrase `Ni Re Ga Ma Pa Re Sa` can be rendered in Hamsadhwani as `Ni Re Ga Pa Re Sa`. It also has its own characteristic phrases such as `Ga Re Ga Pa Ni Pa`, `Ga Re Ni' Pa' Re Sa`, where the important intervals of `(Pa,Ni)` and `(Pa',Re)` are used prominently.

export const hamsadhwaniMotif = `Sa Re Ga Pa Ni SA 2
SA Ni Pa Ga Pa Re Ga Sa Re Ga Re Sa 2`

## Raga Hindol

Raga Hindol is widely accepted to be related to Raga Kalyani. Indeed, it can be arrived at by dropping Re and Pa from Kalyani. Raga Hindol uses the symmetry `(Ma,Dha) = (Dha,SA)` and `(Ma,Ni)` = *Madhyam Bhav* interval. Again, if you observe closely, you can see that these relationships are already present in Raga Kalyani.

Some characteristic phrases of Raga Hindol using these *Lakshanas* would be `Ma Ga Ma Dha SA` and `SA Ni Dha Ma`.

export const hindolMotif = `Sa Ga Ma Dha SA 2
SA Ni Dha Ma Ga Ma Ga Sa 2`

## Concluding Remarks

Like in the previous article, here again we looked at Ragas Kalyani, Hamsadhwani and Hindol. We examined a few of their signature phrases and applied the basic intervals of Pancham, Madhyam and Antara Gandhar to tune the scale for making it aesthetically appealing. We found that the note relationships and symmetry required for Raga Hamsadhwani and Raga Hindol are present in Raga Kalyani. Thus, Raga Kalyani can be considered a parent Raga, while Raga Hamsadhwani and Raga Hindol can be considered as derivative Ragas. They share a common tuning system and some common Lakshanas. Therefore, they can be performed with the same drone tuning which supports the complete scale of Raga Kalyani.

The remarkable observation is that the mutual relationship between these three Ragas works regardless of whether `(Re,Ma)` is taken as symmetrical to `(Pa,Ni)` or whether `(Sa,Ga)` is taken as symmetrical to `(Pa,Ni)`.
