## Introduction

In an [earlier article](/learn/raga-classification/), we surveyed several systems of Raga classification used in Indian Classical music, with all of them sharing a common thread, namely, the concept of a *parent Raga* and a *derivative Raga*. The parent and derivative Ragas share a common tuning systems and note intervals.

In this series of articles, we would be selecting some popular Ragas, analyzing their scales and examining the parent-child relationship between them. We looked at Ragas *Kalyani*, *Hamsadhwani* and *Hindol* in these two articles ([part 1](/learn/kalyani-hamsadhwani-hindol/) and [part 2](/learn/kalyani-hamsadhwani-hindol-2/)).

For this article, we have selected two Ragas, namely, *Shankarabharanam* and *Kaushika Dhwani*.

*Raga Shankarabharanam* is a very popular Raga which is performed all over India, in various traditions, including Hindustani and Carnatic. It is popularly known as *Raga Bilawal* in North India. *Raga Kaushika Dhwani* is quite popular too. It is also known as *Raga Bhinna Shadaj*. 

By means of this article, we will see how these Ragas relate to each other and how they can be seen to share a common tuning system.

## Reference Pitch and Basic Intervals

Before we begin, let us start with the concept of the fundamental note **Sa**. In Indian Classical music, all musical notes are defined based on their relationship with **Sa**. You can use the settings below to set the **Sa** to any pitch you prefer. All the demos on this page would play according to this setting.

<CommonPitch />

Next, it is useful to familiarize ourselves with the four basic intervals of *Dviguna*  (octave), *Pancham* (fifth), *Madhyam* (fourth) and *Gandhar* (major third). You can play and check these intervals using the keyboard below (just click `Start` to activate and tap a key to play). Here **Sa** denotes the fundamental and **Ga, ma, Pa** and **SA** denote the Gandhar, Madhyam, Pancham and Dviguna respectively. Note that the notes here do not match up with today's standard [12 tone equally tempered scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_equal_temperament).

As you can hear, Pancham, Madhyam and Gandhar are pleasant sounding intervals. For the musically inclined, they may be recognisable by ear. These are the most fundamental intervals in Indian Classical music which a trained musician is expected to recognize with a fine level of precision.

## Scale for Raga Shankarabharanam

Let us start by examining some common phrases. Here are a few fragments of phrases which are used to construct musical phrases in Raga Shankarabharanam.

```
Ga Re Ga Pa ma Ga
Ni' Re Ga ma Ga Pa
Ga Pa Dha ma Ga 
Pa Ni Dha Ni SA
Ni Dha Pa Dha ma Ga Re Ni' Sa
SA Ni Dha Pa ma Ga Pa ma Ga Re Ni' Sa
```

Based on these phrase fragments, we can deduce the note relationships required for the phrases to sound correct and aesthetically appealing. Using the basic intervals introduced above, we can see that:

* `Ga Re Ga Pa ma Ga` which starts with Ga and has a prominent Ga, would sound pleasing if `(Sa,Ga)` is an *Antara Gandhar* interval. 

* Similarly, `Ga Pa Dha ma Ga` would sound pleasing if `(ma,Dha)` is an *Antara Gandhar* interval. 
 
* For the phrase `Ni' Re Ga ma Ga Pa`, setting `(Pa,Ni)` to *Antara Gandhar* and `(Re,Pa)` to *Madhyam* ensures that `(Ga,Pa)` and `(Ni',Re)` are identical, and this brings symmetry to the phrase.

* Note that setting `(Re,Pa)` to *Madhyam*, means that `Re` and `Dha` are not mutually consonant.

It is important to note that in addition to the phrases, it is equally important to pay attention to the timing of notes in a phrase, and the [usage characteristics](/learn/grammar-of-music) like *Alpatva*, *Bahutva*, *Hrasva* or *Deergha* of the notes in the phrase to determine the appropriate pairings.

Using the above analysis of the phrases, the scale for Raga Shankarabharanam can be built using the [Scale Builder](/scalebuilder/) tool with the following inter-note relationships.

```
(Sa,Ga) = I(G)
(Sa,ma) = I(m)
(Sa,Pa) = I(P)
(ma,Dha) = I(G)
(Pa,Ni) = I(G)
(Re,Pa) = I(m)
```

The above relationships result in the following scale. Click `Start` below to expand the scale controls. Then play each note one at a time. For each note, observe how it sounds in relation to other notes in the scale.

export const noteSpecShankarabharanam = [
    {white: "Sa", black: "fade"},

    {white: "Pa", black: "fade"},
    {white: "Dha", black: "fade"},
    {white: "Ni"},
    {white: "SA"}

## Drone for Raga Shankarabharanam

Before we compare Raga Shankarabharanam with Raga Kaushika Dhwani, let us start with the drone track for Raga Shankarabharanam. Click `Start` below and listen to the drone track for some time.

<DronePlayer title='Drone for Raga Shankarabharanam' settings={shankarabharanamDrone} />

After you have spent some time and feel comfortable with the drone track, you can move to the subsequent sections. Let the drone track continue to play while you read and listen to the remainder of this article.

## Raga Kaushika Dhwani

Raga Kaushika Dhwani is a pentatonic Raga with the scale `Sa Ga ma Dha Ni`. Here we present it as a derivative of *Raga Shankarabharanam*.

The important inter-note relationships in Raga Kaushika Dhwani are as follows:

```
(Sa,Ga) = I(G)
(Sa,ma) = I(m)
(ma,Dha) = I(G)
```

If you observe closely, you can see that these relationships are already present among those listed for Raga Shankarabharanam. So, by dropping Pa and Re (Pa, Re are *Varjit* or prohibited), we can arrive at the required scale with the required symmetry for Raga Kaushika Dhwani.

Some Shankarabharanam phrases can directly be rendered in Raga Kaushika Dhwani just by dropping the *Varjit* notes. For example, the Shankarabharanam phrase `Dha Pa Dha ma Ga` can be rendered in Kaushika Dhwani as `Dha ma Ga`. It also has its own characteristic phrases such as `Dha' Ni' Sa Ga ma Ga Sa`, `Ga ma Dha Ni Dha ma Ga`, where the important intervals of `(Sa,Ga)` and `(ma',Dha)` are used prominently.

## Simple phrases in Raga Kaushika Dhwani

export const kaushikadhwaniMotif = `Ni' Dha' Ni' Sa Ga 2 Sa Ga ma Dha 2 ma Dha Ni SA 2
SA Ni Dha ma Ga ma Dha ma Ga Re Sa Ni' Sa 2`

<MotifPlayer title='Aarohi and Avarohi phrases for Raga Kaushika Dhwani' motif={kaushikadhwaniMotif} scale={shankarabharanamScale} />

Note that we have also used Re in the phrase above. Re is to be used as an *ati-Alpatva* (very ocassionally) *Hrasva* note.

## Concluding Remarks

In this article, we looked at Ragas Shankarabharanam and Kaushika Dhwani. We examined a few of their signature phrases and applied the basic intervals of Pancham, Madhyam and Antara Gandhar to tune the scale for making it aesthetically appealing. We found that the note relationships and symmetry required for Raga Kaushika Dhwani are present in Raga Shankarabharanam.

Thus, Raga Shankarabharanam can be considered a parent Raga, while Raga Kaushika Dhwani can be considered a derivative Raga. They share a common tuning system and some common Lakshanas. Therefore, they can be performed with the same drone tuning which supports the complete scale of Raga Shankarabharanam.

A keen listener would have noticed that `Re` and `Dha` were not mutually consonant in this tuning. It is possible to construct an alternative tuning where `(Re,Dha)` is set to *Pancham*. As a consequence, in the alterative tuning, `Re` and `Pa` are not mutually consonant. We explore this alternative tuning, in the [next article](/learn/shankarabharanam-kaushikadhwani-2/).
