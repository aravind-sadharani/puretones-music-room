## Background

In an [earlier article](/learn/raga-classification/), we surveyed several systems of Raga classification which have been used in Indian Classical music. While these systems have their differences, the common thread in all classification systems is the concept of a *parent Raga* and a *derivative Raga*. The parent and derivative Ragas share a common tuning systems and note intervals.

In this series of articles, we would be selecting some popular Ragas, analyzing their scales and examining the parent-child relationship between them.

## Introduction

For this article, we have selected three Ragas, namely, *Kalyani*, *Hamsadhwani* and *Hindol*.

*Raga Kalyani* is a very popular Raga which is performed all over India, in various traditions including Hindustani and Carnatic. *Raga Hamsadhwani* is also equally popular all throughout India. *Raga Hindol* is somewhat less commonly performed in South India.

Through this article, we will see how these Ragas relate to each other and how they can be seen to share a common tuning system.

## Common Pitch

Before we begin, let us start with the fundamental note **Sa**. In Indian Classical music, all musical notes are defined based on their relationship with **Sa**. You can use the settings below to set the **Sa** to any pitch you prefer. All the demos on this page would play according to this setting.

## Constructing the scale of Raga Kalyani

Let us start by examining some common phrases in Raga Kalyani. Here are a few fragments of phrases which are used to construct musical phrases in Raga Kalyani.

```
Re Ma Ga
Ga Ma Dha Pa
Ma Dha Ni Dha Pa
Ma Ni Dha Pa
```

Based on these phrase fragments, we can deduce the note relationships required for the phrases to sound correct and aesthetically appealing.

For example, `Re Ma Ga` would sound right if `(Re,Ma)` is an *Antara Gandhar* interval.

Similarly, `Ga Ma Dha Pa` would sound right if `(Ga,Pa)` and `(Ma,Dha)` are identical intervals.

## Scale for Raga Kalyani

The scale for Raga Kalyani can be built using the [Scale Builder](/scalebuilder/) tool with the following inter-note relationships.

```
(Sa,Pa) = I(P)
(Re,Pa) = I(m)
(Re,Ma) = I(G)
(Ga,Pa) = (Ma,Dha)
(Ma,Ni) = I(m)
(Ga,Dha) = I(m)
```

The above relationships result in the following scale. Click `Start` below to expand the scale controls. Then play each note one at a time. For each note, observe how it sounds in relation to other notes in the scale.

export const noteSpecKalyani = [
    {white: "Sa", black: "fade"},
    {white: "Re", black: "fade"},
    {white: "Ga"},
    {white: "fade", black: "Ma"},
    {white: "Pa", black: "fade"},
    {white: "Dha", black: "fade"},
    {white: "Ni"},
    {white: "SA"}
]
