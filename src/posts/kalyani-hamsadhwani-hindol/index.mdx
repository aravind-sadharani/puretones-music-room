## Background

In an [earlier article](/learn/raga-classification/), we surveyed several systems of Raga classification which have been used in Indian Classical music. While these systems have their differences, the common thread in all classification systems is the concept of a *parent Raga* and a *derivative Raga*. The parent and derivative Ragas share a common tuning systems and note intervals.

In this series of articles, we would be selecting some popular Ragas, analyzing their scales and examining the parent-child relationship between them.

## Introduction

For this article, we have selected three Ragas, namely, *Kalyani*, *Hamsadhwani* and *Hindol*.

*Raga Kalyani* is a very popular Raga which is performed all over India, in various traditions including Hindustani and Carnatic. *Raga Hamsadhwani* is also equally popular all throughout India. *Raga Hindol* is somewhat less commonly performed in South India.

Through this article, we will see how these Ragas relate to each other and how they can be seen to share a common tuning system.

## Common Pitch

Before we begin, let us start with the fundamental note **Sa**. In Indian Classical music, all musical notes are defined based on their relationship with **Sa**. You can use the settings below to set the **Sa** to any pitch you prefer. All the demos on this page would play according to this setting.

## Constructing the scale of Raga Kalyani

Let us start by examining some common phrases in Raga Kalyani. Here are a few fragments of phrases which are used to construct musical phrases in Raga Kalyani.

```
Re Ma Ga
Ga Ma Dha Pa
Ma Dha Ni Dha Pa
Ma Ni Dha Pa
Ma Dha Ni Dha Pa
Ni Re Ga Ma Pa Re Sa
```

Based on these phrase fragments, we can deduce the note relationships required for the phrases to sound correct and aesthetically appealing. It is pertinent to mention here that 4 important natural intervals that appeal to human hearing are:

1. *Dviguna* or Octave
2. *Pancham Bhav* or the Fifth
3. *Madhyam Bhav* or the Fourth
4. *Antara Gandhara Bhav* or the Major Third

Based on these intervals, we can see that:

In `Re Ma Ga` would sound pleasing if `(Re,Ma)` is an *Antara Gandhar* interval.

Similarly, in `Ga Ma Dha Pa` would sound pleasing if `(Ga,Dha)` is an *Madhyam Bhav* interval. In addition if `(Ga,Pa)` and `(Ma,Dha)` are identical intervals, it brings symmetry to the phrase.

If we look at two other common phrases in Kalyani `Ma Ni Dha Pa` and `Ma Dha Ni Dha Pa`, `(Ma,Ni)` being a *Madhyam Bhav* interval and `(Pa,Ni)` being an *Antara Gandhara* interval would be aesthetically most pleasing.

## Scale for Raga Kalyani

Using the above analysis of the phrases, the scale for Raga Kalyani can be built using the [Scale Builder](/scalebuilder/) tool with the following inter-note relationships.

```
(Sa,Pa) = I(P)
(Re,Pa) = I(m)
(Re,Ma) = I(G)
(Ga,Pa) = (Ma,Dha)
(Ma,Ni) = I(m)
(Ga,Dha) = I(m)
```

The above relationships result in the following scale. Click `Start` below to expand the scale controls. Then play each note one at a time. For each note, observe how it sounds in relation to other notes in the scale.

export const noteSpecKalyani = [
    {white: "Sa", black: "fade"},
    {white: "Re", black: "fade"},
    {white: "Ga"},
    {white: "fade", black: "Ma"},
    {white: "Pa", black: "fade"},
    {white: "Dha", black: "fade"},
    {white: "Ni"},
    {white: "SA"}
]

## Drone for Raga Kalyani

Before we compare Raga Kalyani with Raga Hamsadhwani and Raga Hindol, let us start with the drone track for Raga Kalyani. Click `Start` below and listen to the drone track for some time.

<DronePlayer title='Drone for Raga Kalyani' settings={kalyaniDrone} />

After you have spent some time and feel comfortable with the drone track, you can move to the subsequent sections. Let the drone track continue to play while you read and listen to the remainder of this article.

Note that the drone has been tuned to support the Kalyani scale derived above and to emphasize the associated note relationships.

## Relating Raga Hamsadhwani and Raga Kalyani

Some remarks.

## Raga Hamsadhwani

**Important Bhav**

```
(Sa,Pa) = I(P)
(Pa',Re) = I(P)
(Pa,Ni) = I(G)
```
By dropping Ma and Dha (Ma, Dha Varjit), we can arrive at the scale and the symmetry in Raga Hamsadhwani. Many of the Kalyani phrases can directly be rendered in Raga Hamsadhwani just by dropping the Varjit notes. For example, the Kalyani phrase `Ni Re Ga Ma Pa Re Sa` can be rendered in Hamsadhwani as `Ni Re Ga Pa Re Sa`. It also has its own characteristic phrases such as `Ga Re Ga Pa Ni Pa`, `Ga Re Ni' Pa' Re Sa`, where the important intervals of `(Pa,Ni)` and `(Pa',Re)` are used prominently.

export const hamsadhwaniMotif = `Sa Re Ga Pa Ni SA 2
SA Ni Pa Ga Pa Re Ga Sa Re Ga Re Sa 2`

## Relating Raga Hindol and Raga Kalyani

Some remarks.

## Raga Hindol

Raga Hindol can be arrived at by dropping Re and Pa from Kalyani. This Raga uses the symmetry `(Ma,Dha) = (Dha,SA)` and `(Ma,Ni)` = *Madhyam Bhav* interval. Some characteristic phrases of Raga Hindol using these *Lakshanas* would be `Ma Ga Ma Dha SA`, `SA Ni Dha Ma'.

export const hindolMotif = `Sa Ga Ma Dha SA 2
SA Ni Dha Ma Ga Ma Ga Sa 2`
